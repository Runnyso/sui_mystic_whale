# Sui Mystic Whale Oracle

This script doesn't track whales.  
It listens to them.

When someone moves >500k SUI in a single breath,  
the terminal doesn’t scream —  
it **whispers**.

Because on Sui,  
the biggest moves aren’t loud.  
They’re inevitable.

You’re not watching transactions.  
You’re witnessing fate being rewritten in parallel execution.

python sui_mystic_whale.py
